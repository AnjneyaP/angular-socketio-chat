# Angular-Flavored Chat

Sample AngularJS + NodeJS/Express application demonstrating the use of
Socket.IO.  I am using:

* [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org)
* [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org)
* [Express](http://expressjs.com) - NOTE I'm using 3.5
* [Socket.IO and Socket.IO Client](http://socket.io) for web socket
  support
* [Brian Ford's Angular Socket IO
  client](https://github.com/btford/angular-socket-io)
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and both the
  [Express](https://www.npmjs.org/package/generator-express) and
  [AngularJS](https://www.npmjs.org/package/generator-angular) [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generators.

This project was a simple test of sockets as a traditional (some might
say 'ye olde') chat program. I wanted to write it as angularly as
possible (is that really a word?) and use the traditional Grunt-based
workflow of Yeoman where possible.

I am not using Node at this point for anything more than a chat
websocket server, however now you're nicely set up for an /api (see the
/route directory and js file for a stupid JSON example).
